      <p>The Dijkstra algorithm finds the shortest path from one vertex to all other vertices, which is widely used in network routing protocols and is foundational for many types of network analysis.</p>

      <p>The PIM system we used for comparison with GPU, is a process-in-memory system that having multiple data process unit (DPU) located near the memory. This type of architecture aim for improving the performance by reducing the data movement within the cache hierarchy. Since the DPU is located close to the memory, the network latency for the memory access can be also reduced. </p>
    
      <p>Here are several aspects of the algorithm that can benefit greatly from parallelism:</p>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>1. Handling each destination vertex: each thread compute the shortest distance between a vertex and the source. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>2. Construct priority queue: compute the shortest distance between vertexes in parallel.</p>

      <p>Despite being a well-studied shortest path graph search algorithm, parallel implementation of Dijkstra algorithm faces challenges:</p>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Memory Access Characteristics: Graph search often exhibit irregular memory access patterns, as the pointer of a vertex is arbitrary distributed in the memory, showing limited temporal and spatial data locality.</p> 
        <!-- <p><i>"Use products from nature for what it's worth - but never too early, nor too late." Fresh is the new sweet.</i></p>
        <p>Chef, Coffeeist and Owner: Liam Brown</p> -->
      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Divergent Execution: The path in graph have various length, some threads might exit early as the path involve less vertex.</p> 
        <!-- <p><i>"Use products from nature for what it's worth - but never too early, nor too late." Fresh is the new sweet.</i></p>
        <p>Chef, Coffeeist and Owner: Liam Brown</p> -->
      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Workload imbalance: The graph search algorithm is inherently workload imbalanced, as the number of edge connecting different vertex varies, dependent on the graph topology.</p> 
        <!-- <p><i>"Use products from nature for what it's worth - but never too early, nor too late." Fresh is the new sweet.</i></p>
        <p>Chef, Coffeeist and Owner: Liam Brown</p> -->
      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Communication Overhead: there are constraints on the communication bandwidth in GPU and DPU if the data to transfer is too large. The synchronization between threads for updating the shortest path length also require inherent communication.</p>

        The deliverables are the CUDA implementation and the PIM implementation of the algorithms, and analysis of our parallel implementation of the two architecture with comparison. We will show speedup graphs and profiling results, and discuss the results.
