      <p>The decision tree is an algorithm for classification, with a tree-like structure in which each branch is the outcome of a test, and a leaf node is the class label. The path from the root to each leaf node is the classification rule of the class. </p>
      <img src="./decisionTree.jpeg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
    
      <p>Here are several aspects of the algorithm that can benefit greatly from parallelism:</p>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>1. Splitting on Attributes: The decision tree algorithm evaluates each attribute to determine the best split. This process involves calculating a metric (such as information gain, Gini impurity, or entropy reduction) for each attribute across all examples. Since the calculation for each attribute is independent of the others, these calculations can be performed in parallel, potentially reducing the overall time to identify the best splitting attribute.</p>

        <p>Chef, Coffeeist and Owner: Liam Brown</p> -->
      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>2. Handling Subtrees: After selecting an attribute to split on, the algorithm recursively creates new subtrees for each value of the attribute. These subtrees are independent of each other since they operate on disjoint subsets of the dataset. The construction of these subtrees can be parallelized, allowing multiple branches of the tree to be constructed simultaneously. This is particularly beneficial for deep trees or datasets with a large number of categorical values, where the algorithm can branch out significantly.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>3. Data Partitioning: When splitting the dataset based on the best attribute, the partitioning step can also be parallelized. Each record in the dataset can be independently evaluated to determine which subset (or branch) it belongs to based on the splitting criterion. This process can be efficiently parallelized by distributing the data across multiple processors and performing the partitioning in parallel.</p>

      <p>Though decision tree is well-studied as a machine learning algorithm, it contains many typical challenges when it comes to parallel implementation. There are many nuances in implementing large-scale parallel training of decision tree. At its core, the decision tree algorithm is sequential because each node split depends on the outcome of the previous one. This sequential dependency can make it difficult to fully parallelize the algorithm, especially in the early stages of tree construction where the choice of the root node and its immediate splits significantly influence the structure of the entire tree.</p>
      <p>However, we can still parallelize some intermediate process</p>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Data Dependencies: When constructing a decision tree, splits at higher levels of the tree create data subsets that are processed independently at lower levels. While processing these subsets can be parallelized, the initial splits have a cascading effect, creating dependencies that dictate the flow of computation.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Memory Access Characteristics: Decision trees often exhibit irregular memory access patterns, especially in datasets with categorical variables leading to variable-sized splits. This irregularity can reduce memory locality and efficiency. Additionally, the need to repeatedly scan the entire dataset for evaluating splits can lead to a high memory access to computation ratio.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Divergent Execution: The nature of decision tree learning can lead to divergent execution paths, especially in trees with varying depths across branches. This divergence can make workload distribution among parallel processors challenging, as some processors may idle while waiting for others to complete their tasks.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p>Workload imbalance: The decision tree is inherently workload imbalance, since the resultant tree might be imbalanced and the prediction process for each input will also vary depending on the depth of the corresponding node of that input. The imbalance work makes it difficult to obtain an ideal speedup when implemented on the GPU.</p>

        The baseline goal for our project is to achieve a good speedup for distributed decision tree compared to the baseline sequential decision tree.
        The goal that we hope to achieve is to see a near linear speedup for our distributed decision tree algorithm.
